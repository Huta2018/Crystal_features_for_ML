# Construction of material network, using various descriptors
To run the script one need to install the following packages:

Python (installing with anaconda is the best option)

Pymatgen : get it from https://pymatgen.org

robocrys: get it from https://pypi.org/project/robocrys/

Matminer: get it from https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer/

This Ipython-Notebook can be used to generate descriptors for crystal structure. Which later can be used for the material property (such as band gap, formation energy) and other properties prediction task. 

In this example I have extracted various features from the crystal structures and used them to construct a material network graph, which is visualized using Network and Gephi. The constructed material network graph for few materials is shown as an example.
