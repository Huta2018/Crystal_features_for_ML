# Material_net_features
To run the script one need to install the following packages:

Python (installing with anaconda is the best option)

Pymatgen : get it from https://pymatgen.org

robocrys: get it from https://pypi.org/project/robocrys/

Matminer: get it from https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer/

This script can be used to generate various featurs from material datasets, which later can be used for the machine learning task in materials such as band gap, formation energy, and many other property prediction task.

In this example I have used the generated features to construct the material graph and visualize it using networkx and gephi. I have presented the constructed network for 108 transparent conducting oxides.
